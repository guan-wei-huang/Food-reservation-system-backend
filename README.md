To run the app, use the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will build and start the app, along with any required services and dependencies defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

Once the app is running, you can access it by sending HTTP requests to http://localhost:8080 using tools such as Postman or cURL.
